# This script is called by cron every 30 minutes and attempts to fetch
# the current exitlist from the check host.
#
# Also, it sends a HUP to BridgeDB in order to make it reload the exitlist.
# While we could as well wait for Tonga's store-bridge-tarball script to HUP
# BridgeDB after uploading new descriptors, we want to make sure that BridgeDB
# has a recent exitlist even when Tonga is down.
#
# If something breaks, ask kaner or karsten.
