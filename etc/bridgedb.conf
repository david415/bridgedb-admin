# CHANGELOG:
# ~~~~~~~~~~ 
# Changes in version 0.0.2 - 2014-01-17
#   * ADD missing settings, EMAIL_GPG_SIGNING_ENABLED and EMAIL_GPG_SIGNING_KEY.
#
# Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2013-08-30
#   * ADD version of config file in use on ponticum.
#     - Two config variables, RECAPTCHA_PUB_KEY and RECAPTCHA_PRIV_KEY, have
#       been removed, they can be found in:
#       patches/001-bridgedb-conf-recaptcha-vars.patch.
#   * CLEANUP the config file slightly (such as adding these headers) and
#     fixing the linewraps. No other variables were touched.
